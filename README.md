# DevDuck agents

A multi-agent system for Node.js programming assistance built with Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). This
project features a coordinating agent (DevDuck) that manages two specialized sub-agents (Local Agent and
Cerebras) for different programming tasks.

## Architecture

The system consists of three main agents orchestrated by Docker Compose, which plays a
**primordial role** in launching and coordinating all agent services:

### 🐙 Docker Compose Orchestration

- **Central Role**: Docker Compose serves as the foundation for the entire multi-agent system
- **Service Orchestration**: Manages the lifecycle of all three agents (DevDuck, Local Agent, and Cerebras)
- **Configuration Management**: Defines agent prompts, model configurations, and service dependencies
  directly in the compose file
- **Network Coordination**: Establishes secure inter-agent communication channels
- **Environment Management**: Handles API keys, model parameters, and runtime configurations

### Agent Components

### 🦆 DevDuck (Main Agent)

- **Role**: Main development assistant and project coordinator
- **Model**: llama3
- **Capabilities**: Routes requests to appropriate sub-agents based on user needs

### 👨‍💻 Local Agent Agent

- **Role**: General development tasks and project coordination
- **Model**: mistral
- **Specialization**: Node.js programming expert for understanding code, explaining concepts, and generating code snippets

### 🧠 Cerebras Agent

- **Role**: Advanced computational tasks and complex problem-solving
- **Model**: Llama-4 Scout (llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct)
- **Provider**: Cerebras API
- **Specialization**: Node.js programming expert for complex problem-solving scenarios

## Features

- **Multi-agent coordination**: Routing between specialized agents
- **Node.js programming expertise**: All agents specialize in Node.js development
- **FastAPI web interface**: RESTful API with web interface support
- **Docker containerization**: Easy deployment with Docker Compose
- **Flexible model configuration**: Support for multiple LLM providers (local and cloud)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **[Docker Desktop] 4.43.0+ or [Docker Engine]** installed.
- **A laptop or workstation with a GPU** (e.g., a MacBook) for running open models locally. If you
  don't have a GPU, you can alternatively use **[Docker Offload]**.
- If you're using [Docker Engine] on Linux or [Docker Desktop] on Windows, ensure that the
  [Docker Model Runner requirements] are met (specifically that GPU
  support is enabled) and the necessary drivers are installed.
- If you're using Docker Engine on Linux, ensure you have [Docker Compose] 2.38.1 or later installed.

### Configuration

1. **You need a Cerebras API Key**: <https://cloud.cerebras.ai/>
2. Create a `.env` file with the following content:

```env
CEREBRAS_API_KEY=<your_cerebras_api_key>
CEREBRAS_BASE_URL=https://api.cerebras.ai/v1
CEREBRAS_CHAT_MODEL=llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct
```

> look at the `.env.sample` file

### ✋ All the prompts are defined in the 🐙 compose file

### Start the services

```bash
docker compose up
# if you updated the code, use --build
```

The application will be available at [http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:8000)

### Usage

The agents can be accessed through the web interface or API endpoints.

**You can try this**:

```text
Hello I'm Phil

Local Agent generate a Node.js hello world program

Add a Person class with a greet method

Cerebras can you analyse and comment this code

Can you generate the tests
```

> ✋ For a public demo, stay simple, the above examples are working.

#### Routing Requests

- **General requests**: Handled by DevDuck, who routes to appropriate sub-agents
- **Specific agent requests**
  + "I want to speak with Local Agent" → Routes to Local Agent agent
  + "I want to speak with Cerebras" → Routes to Cerebras agent

## Tips

If for any reason, you cannot go back from the Cerebras agent to the Local Agent agent, try this:

```text
go back to devduck
